Q. Why isn't my favorite gas station listed in the suggested gas stations when I fill up?

A. Fuse uses the Google Places API to get a list of nearby gas stations when the driver records a fuel purchase. Sometimes businesses are not in Google Places or are miscategorized. This <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/09/suggesting_changes_to_google_places.shtml">blog post</a> explains how you can suggest edits to your favorite gas station so that it's correctly categorized and shows up in Fuse.

Q. Why did my GPS report the wrong location?

A. Two answers: off a little and off a lot. 

Off a lot: Possible issues:

- the number and/or position of the GPS Satellites may have been in a
state that made it difficult to calculate the coordinates correctly
- the device may have been downloading ephemeris data (the set of
parameters that can be used to accurately calculate the location of a
GPS satellite at a particular point in time) during that time period and
had an issue with the receiver while it was downloading
- the GPS may have experienced atmospheric effects which could cause it
to be off
- the GPS may have experienced multipath issues (where signals reflect
off of things and cause all sorts of weird issues). Things like tunnels,
buildings and hills can make GPS data unreliable at times
- there may have been an issue with one of the satellites, but I didn't
see any posted outages with GPS satellites during that time.

Any of these things can give incorrect GPS coordinates.
