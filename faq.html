<p>
<b>What cars does Fuse work with?
</b>
</p>

<p>
Every US vehicle sold after January 1996 has an OBD II data port <a href="http://www.carmd.com/70.6/Article/Find-My-Car's-Connector">near the driver's seat</a> that Fuse can plug into. Not all cars support all data. The GPS and cellular connection always work, however and most of Fuse's functionality depends on those.
</p>

<li>

<p>
<b>Are there plans to make the Fuse available outside of the US?
</b>
</p>

<p>
We'll soon be offering Fuse to international customers too. <a href="https://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/29833E13872FEA85">Sign up here</a> to be notified when Fuse is available internationally.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>How hard is the installation and configuration?</b>
</p>

<p>
Fuse simply plugs into the easily accessible OBD II port that is already on your 1996 or later vehicle. There is a simple configuration accessed from a unique QR code or URL on the device that will allow your to set up your account. No tools are required and set up is simple and easy.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>Do I need a data plan?
</b>
</p>

<p>
No, the Fuse data plan is included with the price of the device for 24 months. There is not data plan or monthly fee to use Fuse.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>What happens after 24 months?</b>
</p>

<p>
Its hard to tell what will happen with cellular data pricing that far out, but we anticipate it will continue to fall. The data may continue to be free after 24 months, but we can't guarantee it. Any charge would be small and easily affordable. 
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>Why does the device have its own cellular modem? Why not just use my smartphone?
</b>
</p>

<p>
Fuse leverages a sensor plugged into your car, the cloud and a new mobile app to combine your life. The sensor connects using cellular technology to the cloud, constantly sharing the data into your private account. Using a sensor with built-in cellular technology enables you to get a constant stream of data from your car, even when you or your smartphone are not in the car.

Fuse doesn't require any pairing with a phone and works with multiple drivers. For example, Fuse works when your teen, with a plain old cell phone, is driving the car. Or when your car is parked. See this <a href="http://kck.st/HGu7Yj">update for more information</a>.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>Where is my OBD II Port?
</b>
</p>

<p>
The port must be within 3 feet of the driver and accessible without using any tools. Check in your car under the dashboard or under the steering wheel. This <a href="https://www.carmd.com/70.6/Article/Find-My-Car's-Connector">article on CarMD can tell you for any given make and model where the port is located.</a>
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>Will I be able to use my existing OBD II device with your software?
</b>
</p>

<p>
You can use any CalAmp LMU-3000 (GSM) or Xirgo XT-2000 (GSM) with the Fuse network and mobile app. To do so, your device will need to be reflashed to load a new script. Your device will also need a new SIM card to put it onto the network we use for device connectivity.  Note: your device can only work with one network at a time, so making your device compatible with Fuse will mean that it no longer works with the system it is currently on. 
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>Can I switch cars after installing Fuse?
</b>
</p>

<p>
You can move it between vehicles, but you'll have to update the profile to indicate the new vehicle. Switching is designed for moving it to a new car, not moving it back and forth between two cars.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>Will there be an API?
</b>
</p>

<p>
Yes, the iPhone and Android apps will be using an API to access the logic behind all this and we will publish that interface. It's controlled by OAuth, so anyone will be able to use an app you build on the API to connect to their car on Fuse.
